## Model Selection in Python

The above Python files contains the coding for respective models and also contains the code to calculate the R Squared for those regression models. Upon running each model and calculating their R Squared values, we find that Random Forest Regression has the maximum R Squared value, and thus for the Data.csv dataset, we Random Forest Regression is the best model to use and predict values. 


The R-Squared for this Multiple Linear Regression model is 0.9321860060402447.

The R-Squared for this Polynomial Linear Regression model is 0.8390869474389655

The R-Squared for this Decision Tree Regression model is 0.8847281801757056.

The R-Squared for this Random Forest Regression model is 0.9891903786733535.

Since the R-Squared for the Random Forest Regression model is the greater than all other regression models, so Random Forest Regression is the most viable regression model to choose if we want to make predictions on this Data.csv dataset.
