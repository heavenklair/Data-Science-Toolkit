# Support Vector Regression

Usually, we talk about SVM before SVR, but for the sake of documentation, here is some important points and intuition before SVR.

Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. In Support Vector Regression, the straight line that is required to fit the data is referred to as hyperplane.
