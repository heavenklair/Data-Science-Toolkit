## False Positive & False Negatives

Let's say that we have a hypothesis, and we are checking it using one of the classfication model.

* **True Positive**: Occurs when the outcome from the model correctly predicts the positive class.

* **True Negative**: Occurs when the outcome from the model correctly predicts the negative class.

* **False Positive**: Occurs when the outcome from the model incorrectly predicts the positive class.

* **False Negative**: Occurs when the outcome from the model incorrectly predicts the negative class.

A **Type I** error is a false positive conclusion, while a **Type II** error is a false negative conclusion.

## Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a summary of prediction results for a classification problem. The x-axis is the predicted axis and y is the actual outcome axis. The values in the matrix are of the predictions.
